At L2D, we have made a conscious decision to employ GitHub’s infrastructure within our course, in order to initiate new users into its ecosystem so that – should you continue to explore coding further after the course – you will already be familiar with one of the leading, internationally-recognised platforms and standards for programmers and coders.\n",
