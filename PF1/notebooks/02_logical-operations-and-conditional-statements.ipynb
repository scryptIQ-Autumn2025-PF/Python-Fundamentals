These always follow an `if` conditional, and explicitly state that if the condition of the `if` isn't met, then proceed to the next `elif` statement. `elif` follows the same syntactical rules as `if`, in that the `elif` keyword is followed by both a condition and a colon `:`, with newline characters automatically indenting a single tab-space in, to specify the code within its scope. This code is then executed if the condition of the `elif` statement is met.\n",

        "In this lesson, we explored how Python makes decisions using **logical operations** and **conditional statements**. We began by learning how **comparison operators** (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`) allow us to compare values and return Boolean results of either `True` or `False`. We then examined how **logical operators** `and`, `or` and `not` enable the *combination* or *negation* of multiple conditions, allowing for more complex decision-making. We then introduced Python’s **conditional statements** — `if`, `elif` and `else` — which allow the program to choose between different paths of execution depending on whether conditions are met. Along the way, we emphasised the importance of **colons** and **indentation** as syntactical rules, both of which define the structure and scope of conditionals in Python. By the end of this lesson, we saw how these tools allow Python programs to respond dynamically to data, modelling real-world decision processes with clarity and precision."
